    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to seasonal patterns in time series data that change over time. In other words, the magnitude or shape of the seasonal variations varies across different periods in the time series. This is in contrast to time series data with constant seasonal patterns, where the seasonality remains consistent throughout the entire data set.\n",

    "In time-dependent seasonal components, the strength and timing of the seasonal effect may be influenced by various factors, such as external events, economic conditions, or changes in consumer behavior. These factors can cause the seasonal patterns to evolve or shift over time."

    "Identifying time-dependent seasonal components in time series data requires careful analysis and exploration of the data. Here are some steps and methods that can help in identifying time-dependent seasonality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Inspection: Start by plotting the time series data over time. Look for patterns, fluctuations, and repeating cycles. If the seasonal patterns appear to change in magnitude or shape over time, this could indicate time-dependent seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal Plots: Create seasonal subseries plots by aggregating data points for each season separately. If the seasonal patterns are not consistent across different seasons or years, it suggests time-dependent seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) Plots: Analyze the ACF and PACF plots of the data. If the autocorrelation at seasonal lags changes over time, it may indicate time-dependent seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decomposition Methods: Use seasonal decomposition methods like Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) or Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) to separate the time series into trend, seasonality, and remainder components"

    "Calendar Events: Events that occur on specific dates, such as holidays, religious festivals, or special occasions, can influence seasonal patterns. For example, the holiday shopping season can lead to increased sales during certain months for retail businesses.\n",

    "Weather Conditions: Weather can significantly impact seasonal patterns, especially in industries like agriculture, tourism, and energy. Seasonal variations in temperature, precipitation, or daylight hours can affect consumer behavior and demand.\n",

    "Economic Factors: Economic conditions, such as business cycles, economic growth, or recessions, can influence seasonal patterns. For instance, during economic downturns, consumer spending patterns may change, leading to altered seasonal trends.\n",

    "Marketing and Promotional Activities: Seasonal advertising campaigns, promotions, or sales events can drive consumer behavior and create temporary shifts in seasonal patterns.\n",
